# Recipe Index

### A way to view recipes without interrupting ads or reading a biography.

## About

Recipe Index is a way users can view, upload, and share recipes that they enjoy! It's as simple as that! Upload your recipes as part of a recipe book or individually, create a brand new empty recipe book or fill it with recipes you already indexed! Print individual recipes or entire books in the same format so that you don't need to rely on greasy index cards written in a thousand different formats. All of these features are rolled into one using Recipe Index.

## Features

- [x] Upload Recipes: You can upload the title, (short) overview, a picture, and the list of steps and ingredients needed to make your recipe.
- [x] Compile and edit Recipe Books: You can build recipe books out of any and all of the recipes you've uploaded. You can always add or take away from them later! Make as many as you'd like!
- [x] View recipes uploaded by others: Check out the home page to find inspiration for your next meal.
- [x] Print your recipes: You can print your recipes in a beautiful format without any hassle. Just press the print icon on the side of your recipes!
